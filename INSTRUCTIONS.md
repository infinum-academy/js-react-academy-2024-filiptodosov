# Assignment #3 materials

Branch `assignment-3-materials` contains the `Materials.zip` file with the necessary files for the 3rd course assignment.
Materials contain:

 - `api` directory
 - `shows.json` file

Before you start working on your assignment you need to:
1. Merge the `assignment-3-materials` branch in your assignment branch
2. Extract the content of the provided `.zip` file
3. Move the extracted `api` directory inside the `src/app/` directory
	- after doing so your `nextjs` project structure should have `src/app/api/...` directory
4. Move `the shows.json` file inside the root (`src`) directory of the project

This is necessary in order to use our mocked API and enable you to fetch the data and proceed with assignment tasks.
